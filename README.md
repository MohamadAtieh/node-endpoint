# node-endpoint
A Node.js RESTful API for user creation, authentication and settings.

This API will be serving my future Android App for basic use cases:

- User Login/Registration
- User Settings - for syncing purposes

This project will be using MongoDB and Mongoose for DB interaction, for now. There could be a possibility that it interacts
with MySQL instead, but this is TBD.

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) for Authentication. 

The main purpose of this project is to illustrate the use of RESTful services with access control by either Basic, Digest or OAuth.
These are possible with the powerful Passport module.

For the mentioned use cases above I might only need Basic Authentication, but I should investigate this matter more.

###This code is open for public reviews, so feel free. Thanks.
